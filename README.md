-   <details>
      <summary>NewLandEvent</summary>
      Triggered when a land is created
      
      *Example*
      ```json
      {
        "event": "NewLandEvent"
        "data": {
          "land": {
            "name": "CubeCity",
            "id": "1bb33d34-8553-401c-aaf8-6cd6f00d1cd4"
          } 
        }
